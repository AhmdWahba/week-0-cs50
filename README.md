Description: This project is a simple interactive game built in Scratch, created for CS50's Week 0 problem set. In this game, players control a rocketship that shoots magical wands. The goal is to guide the rocketship, aiming to hit as many targets as possible with wands. The game uses various Scratch features, including motion, events, and interaction, to create a fun and engaging experience.

Features:

Rocketship Control: Use arrow keys to navigate the rocketship on the screen.
Wand Shooting: Press the spacebar to shoot wands from the rocketship.
Target Interaction: Wands disappear when they hit a target.
This project demonstrates foundational programming concepts using Scratch's block-based interface. Itâ€™s a great starting point for building interactive games with animations and simple controls.
